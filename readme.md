Most popular services: AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform

## The Models

- private cloud
    - the organization have total control of resources and security
    - the organization have to deal with the maintenance and hardware upgrades
    - you own the datacenter
    - the organization are responsible for operating the services
    - users outside the environment doesn’t have access
- public cloud
    - no expenses for vertical scaling
    - shared datacenter
    - the service provider owns the services
    - access by internet
- hybrid cloud
    - public and private datacenters
    - more flexibility
    - good for big corporations
- multi cloud
    - multi models and providers of service

## The Cost

- The Consumption or Usage Based Model
    - Better correlates cost and outcomes for customers to evaluate return on investment and justify future spend.
    - Best control of expenses
- CapEx (capital expenses)

## **IaaS**

Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS, delivers on-demand infrastructure resources to organizations via the cloud, such as compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. 

- Customers don’t have to manage, maintain, or update their own data center infrastructure, but are responsible for the operating system, middleware, virtual machines, and any apps or data.

## **CaaS**

Containers as a service, or CaaS, delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop and deploy applications using containers. Sometimes viewed as a subset or an extension of IaaS, CaaS uses containers rather than VMs as its main resource. 

- Developers and IT operations teams can use CaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform to run and manage containers.
- Customers still have to write the code and manage their data and applications, but the environment to build and deploy containerized apps is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

## **PaaS**

Platform as a service, or PaaS, delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop applications through the cloud. 

- Developers and IT operations teams can use PaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform on their own.
- Customers still have to write the code and manage their data and applications, but the environment to build and deploy apps is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

## **SaaS**

Software as a service, or SaaS, provides the entire application stack, delivering an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use. 

- SaaS products are completely managed by the service provider and come ready to use, including all updates, bug fixes, and overall maintenance.
- Most SaaS applications are accessed directly through a web browser, which means customers don’t have to download or install anything on their devices.
